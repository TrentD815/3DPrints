Design: A Playstation controller holder that can be mounted underneath
        your desk for convenience and to reduce desk clutter
        
Background: The idea for this came when I was talking to my friend about how I've been 3D
            printing things recently and he said he was about to buy something 3D printed online.
            I asked what is was and he showed me a controller mount from some site. I said it 
            seemed simple/feasible enough for me to do it, so I offered to make it for him instead 
            as a challenge for me and to save my friend a little money. He took me up on the offer so 
            I got to work.

Version History:
Pre V1: I started off by creating a partial version of the design just have a prototype to test
        the spacing and how well it actually holds the controller. A bigger print with the 
        incorrect sizes would just be a waste of material and time.
Pre V2: The initial prototype wasn't too bad. The controller analog sticks were able to sit in
        slots as designed but it was pretty tight and hard to easily pull it in and out. So I 
        made the part that the sticks sit on a little thinner to hopefully remedy this. I also 
        rounded a lot of edges to make it look a bit sleeker.
V1:     I was satisfied with Pre V2 so I decided to extend to the full design I had in mine. I
        extended the length of the slots by 2 inches to give extra room for holding. Then I put a 
        cap at the end to prevent it from falling out the back. Finally I rounded some more
        corners to give it a better look and feel.
