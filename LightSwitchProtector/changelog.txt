Design: A shield to cover part of a light switch to prevent it from getting wet.

Background: My girlfriend's apartment has the bathroom lightswitch dangerously close 
to where the shower water can spray. So for peace of mind for both of us, I made this 
shield. This makes it so the light switch doesn't get wet to prevent potential hazards.

v1: 12/31/20 - inital design
v2: 1/9/21 - My friend pointed out to me that there's really no place to attach the 
             part to the wall and he's right. So I went back and added an extra piece
             that has a bigger surface area so it can eventually be glued to the wall
             more securely.
