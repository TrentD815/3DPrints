Designed Part: A mounted wall stand to give our home router a place to sit. 

Background: Our family recently changed ISP's and the person who intially installed 
all the gear velcroed the router to the DVR instead of giving it it's own dedicated 
bracket due to space constraints. Eventually the glue and velcro wore off and left 
the router hanging only by the ethernet cable (poor guy). We tried to re-glue and 
re-velcro several times to no avail. This print is an alternative solution to velcro.

v1: 12/26/20 - initial design
v2: 1/10/21 - The initial design did not self support as much as I thought it would 
              by just having a snug fit. As a result, it could not hold itself or 
              any weight for that matter. So I'm adding a through hole so the piece 
              can be properly mounted to the metal bracket on the wall. I plan to 
              use 2 screws with washers and nuts to mount it firmly to the wall.
