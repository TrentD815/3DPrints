Design: A piece around our shower grab bar that allows for a fuller extra surface

Background: Our shower is a very minimalist design and a result there are not many
            places to put things like shampoo and soap. Often there are items that
            sit on top of the grab bar in the shower which makes them easy targets
            for being knocked over. This print is an attempt to provide more flat
            surface space to put things in the shower
