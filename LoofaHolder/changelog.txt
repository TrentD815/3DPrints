Design: A cap to go on top of our home shower handle

Background: Our home shower is very minimilast and as a result has very little places to hang things. 
So our loofas can only hang on the handle that also turns on the water. When the water is turned on, 
the loofas always slide off onto the ground. This print is designed to prevent them from falling off.

v1: 12/30/20 - initial design
v2: 1/10/21 - There were two issues with the original design. The first was that the hole I cut was
              not big enough and as a result the print would not even fit onto the shower handle. 
              The second was I accidentally put the actual "holder/stopper" protrusion on the wrong
              side because I forgot the piece rotates 90 degrees when in use. I was designing the piece
              without taking that into account. This version increases the size of the hole and switches
              the side that that stops the loofas.
