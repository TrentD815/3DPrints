Design: A shower hair catcher that sits in the shower drain

Background: My girlfriend doesn't want her shower to get clogged with
any of her long hairs so this is an attempt to mitigate that and make
loose hair collection easier.

v1: 1/3/21 - initial design

Side note: This was my first print using supports within Cura and it was defintely a learning experience. 
           The default support settings in Cura were stronger than I thought. I had a very hard time 
           removing all support material in the middle of the print. As a result the top edge of the 
           print is slightly damaged from where I had to continously pick at to get all the support material out.
